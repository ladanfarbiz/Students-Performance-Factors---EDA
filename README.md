# Students-Performance-Factors---EDA
This project explores the relationship between various factors and student performance through an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach. The dataset includes information on student demographics, study habits, and other related factors that could potentially influence exam performance. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations that might shed light on key factors affecting student outcomes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains student data with the following features:

Student Information: Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch, Test Preparation Course.
Student Performance: Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.
Analysis Overview
This notebook provides a comprehensive EDA with a focus on identifying the relationships between the following:

Numerical Features: The relationship between study hours and exam scores.
Categorical Features: Examining categorical features like parental education, lunch type, and test preparation to see their impact on student performance.
Statistical Tests and Visualizations: Use of histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the data, as well as performing statistical tests like correlation analysis and regression.
Key Findings
There is a positive correlation between study hours and exam scores.
Factors such as access to resources, participation in extracurricular activities, engagement in physical activities, and motivation are positively associated with higher exam scores in the average student population.
Parental involvement, family income, and parental education level significantly impact academic performance.
The educational system might not be providing enough support to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, which can contribute to disparities in performance.
